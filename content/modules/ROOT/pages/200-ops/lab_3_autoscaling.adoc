== Introduction

The ARO Cluster Autoscaler is a feature that helps automatically adjust the size of an ARO cluster based on the current workload and resource demands. Cluster Autoscaler offers automatic and intelligent scaling of ARO clusters, leading to efficient resource utilization, improved application performance, high availability, and simplified cluster management. By dynamically adjusting the cluster size based on workload demands, it helps organizations optimize their infrastructure costs while ensuring optimal application performance and scalability. The cluster autoscaler does not increase the cluster resources beyond the limits that you specify.

== Create a Machine Autoscaler

Before we can configure cluster autoscaling, we first need to configure machine autoscaler to scale each of our MachineSets.

While this can be accomplished via the OpenShift Web Console or OpenShift CLI tools, we'll be using the CLI for this part of the workshop.

. Just like the last section, let's pick a MachineSet to add a machine autoscaler.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
MACHINESET=$(oc -n openshift-machine-api get machinesets -o name \
   | cut -d / -f2 | head -1)

echo ${MACHINESET}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
aro-cluster-lwqq8-8mkmr-worker-eastus1
----

. Next, let's use that information to populate a manifest to create a machine autoscaler.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: "autoscaling.openshift.io/v1beta1"
kind: "MachineAutoscaler"
metadata:
  name: "${MACHINESET}"
  namespace: "openshift-machine-api"
spec:
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 3
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
    kind: MachineSet
    name: "${MACHINESET}"
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
machineautoscaler.autoscaling.openshift.io/aro-cluster-lwqq8-8mkmr-worker-eastus1 created
----

. Next, let's check to see that our machine autoscaler has been created.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n openshift-machine-api get machineautoscaler
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
NAME                                     REF KIND     REF NAME                                 MIN   MAX   AGE
aro-cluster-lwqq8-8mkmr-worker-eastus1   MachineSet   aro-cluster-lwqq8-8mkmr-worker-eastus1   1     3     16s
----

== Create a Cluster Autoscaler

. Next, we need to create the cluster autoscaler resource.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: "autoscaling.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterAutoscaler"
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  podPriorityThreshold: -10
  resourceLimits:
    maxNodesTotal: 10
    cores:
      min: 8
      max: 128
    memory:
      min: 4
      max: 256
  scaleDown:
    enabled: true
    delayAfterAdd: 2m
    delayAfterDelete: 1m
    delayAfterFailure: 15s
    unneededTime: 1m
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
clusterautoscaler.autoscaling.openshift.io/default created
----

. Next, let's check to see that our cluster autoscaler has been created.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get clusterautoscaler
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
NAME      AGE
default   22s
----
+
For a detailed explanation of each parameter, see the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/machine_management/applying-autoscaling.html#cluster-autoscaler-cr_applying-autoscaling[Red Hat documentation on the cluster autoscaler].

== Test the Cluster Autoscaler

Now let's test the cluster autoscaler and see it in action.
To do so, we'll deploy a job with a load that this cluster cannot handle.
This should force the cluster to scale to handle the load.

. First, let's create a namespace (also known as a project in OpenShift).
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project autoscale-ex
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "autoscale-ex" on server "https://api.rbrlitrg.westeurope.aroapp.io:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname
----

. Next, let's deploy our job that will exhaust the cluster's resources and cause it to scale more worker nodes.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  generateName: maxscale
  namespace: autoscale-ex
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: work
        image: busybox
        command: ["sleep",  "300"]
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 500Mi
            cpu: 500m
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
  completions: 50
  parallelism: 50
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
job.batch/maxscale7s6c6 created
----

. After a few seconds, run the following to see what pods have been created.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n autoscale-ex get pods
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----

Notice that we see a lot of pods in a pending state.
This should trigger the cluster autoscaler to create more machines using the MachineAutoscaler we created.

. Let's check to see if our MachineSet automatically scaled.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n openshift-machine-api get machinesets
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]

If you see READY and AVAILABLE at 1 still, don't panic! It can take a few minutes for the workers to instantiate. Try checking again after 3-5 minutes.

This shows that the cluster autoscaler is working on scaling the MachineSet up to 3.

. Now let's watch the cluster autoscaler create and delete machines as necessary.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
watch oc -n openshift-machine-api get machines \
   -l "machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role=worker"

Watch will refresh the output of a command every two seconds. Hit CTRL and c on your keyboard to exit the watch command when you're ready to move on to the next part of the workshop.

. When all the pods have run to completion the cluster autoscaler will scale the MachineSet back to just one worker node. This will take a while so we are not waiting for that to happen.
+
You can continue with the next lab while the cluster does its work.

*Congratulations!*

You've successfully demonstrated cluster autoscaling.

== Summary

Here you learned how to:

* Create and configure a machine autoscaler
* Deploy an application on the cluster and watch the cluster autoscaler scale your cluster to support the increased workload
